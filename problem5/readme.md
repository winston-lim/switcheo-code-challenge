# Problem 5: Utility Contract

## Task

Deploy a utility EVM contract with a function to retrieve all token balances given a wallet address and the token contract addresses.

NOTE: Spent >12 hours and did not complete task, so I attached my last attempt in `APIConsumer.sol`

## Overview of solution(failed)

- Read documentations for truffle
- Read documentatioins of Solidity
- Struggled to understand requirements of the problem/come up with solution
- Eventually thought of using an API and found `api.ethplorer.io` which suits problem requirement
- Realized that using APIs in contracts are not easy but went down that rabbit hole
- Read documentations for Chainlink
- (attempted) Wrote contact that makes multiple API calls to find balances for a wallet for each token address
- (attempted) Deployed contract on Remix on Kovan Test Network
- (attempted) Creating a transaction - failed and cannot debug

## Diffulties/ Lessons Learned

- Learnt some solidity syntax
- Learnt various contract terminologies and requirements
- Learnt about contract compilation and deployment
- Learnt about testing networks
